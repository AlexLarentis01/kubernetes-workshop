# Kubernetes and Terraform Workshop Example Repository


Welcome to the Kubernetes and Terraform Workshop example repository! This repository contains multiple examples of deploying applications on Kubernetes using Terraform. Each example focuses on different scenarios, from simple deployments to more complex configurations. Whether you are new to Kubernetes and Terraform or looking to expand your knowledge, these examples will help you understand the basics and beyond.

## Table of Contents

2. [Example 2: NestJS Application on Kubernetes](./example-2-nestjs-kubernetes/README.md)
3. [Example 3: NestJS Application on Kubernetes with Helm](./example-3-nestjs-helm/README.md)
4. [Example 4: NestJS Application on Kubernetes with Terraform](./example-4-nestjs-terraform/README.md)
5. [Example 5: NestJS Application on Kubernetes with Terraform and CDK for Terraform](./example-5-nestjs-terraform-cdk/README.md)
6. [General README](./README.md)

## Getting started

1. Install docker desktop
2. Go to settings > Kubernetes and enable kubernetes
4. wait for a bit, done!
read example readme or use the makefile to deploy


## Example 1: NGINX Deployment

This example demonstrates a basic NGINX deployment on Kubernetes using Terraform. It includes configuration files for creating a Kubernetes namespace, a pod, a deployment, a service, and an ingress. You can find detailed instructions and usage information in the [example 1 README](./example-1-nginx/README.md).

## Example 2: NestJS Application on Kubernetes

This example focuses on deploying a NestJS application on Kubernetes. It provides Docker and Kubernetes configuration files and step-by-step instructions for deployment. You can learn more in the [example 2 README](./example-2-nestjs-kubernetes/README.md).

## Example 3: NestJS Application on Kubernetes with Helm

In this example, you will deploy a NestJS application on Kubernetes using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. The [example 3 README](./example-3-nestjs-helm/README.md) provides detailed information on the setup and deployment process.

## Example 4: NestJS Application on Kubernetes with Terraform

This example demonstrates deploying a NestJS application on Kubernetes using Terraform. You will find Docker and Kubernetes configuration files, as well as a Terraform setup. Learn how to do this in the [example 4 README](./example-4-nestjs-terraform/README.md).

## Example 5: NestJS Application on Kubernetes with Terraform and CDK for Terraform

In this advanced example, you'll deploy a NestJS application on Kubernetes using Terraform and the CDK for Terraform. It includes constructs and stacks for a more complex infrastructure setup. You can explore this in the [example 5 README](./example-5-nestjs-terraform-cdk/README.md).

## General README

The [General README](./README.md) provides an overview of this repository and links to each example's README for detailed instructions. Please read this README first to get an understanding of the contents and structure of the repository.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and use these examples as a learning resource for your Kubernetes and Terraform journey. Happy learning!
